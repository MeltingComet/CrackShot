CrackShot is a collaberative project between OneShot fans, set to pretty much ruin the entire game. 

When Niko "accidentally" licks the acid from the bottle, the poor child goes absolutely mad. Unfortunately, he's probably not the only one.


Guidelines for the Project:
We are sectioning certain maps/variables of dialogue off to those wanting to work on them. 
For writing, avoid resorting to low-level memes. 
Keep all content to at least PG-13, which means anything but NSFW content and really offensive content (Swearing, alcohol/drug references, etc. are fine)
