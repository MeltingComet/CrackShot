CrackShot
a stellar mod of a fantastic video game

CrackShot is a collaberative project between OneShot fans, set to pretty much ruin the entire game. 


Guidelines for the Project:
Here’s the set-up for CrackShot: Niko licks the acid after pouring it onto the sponge to clean the RowBot. What happens next is a bunch of terrible jokes and hallucinating Niko. Most of the dialogue up till when Niko pours the acid on the sponge shouldn’t be changed directly. 
To modify the project, i highly recommend downloading the Drive App (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive/index.html?hl=en), which will allow you to modify the project files from your computer within RPG Maker XP. This is potentially unstable so we’ll have a lot of backups just to be safe. Looking into it atm
We are sectioning certain maps/variables of dialogue off to those wanting to work on them. 
For Art and Music, use the “Art Assets and Crap” Folder and put it in it’s respective folder
Update: Looking into Github at the moment

Installation instructions:

- First time install
1 - First make sure you have a clean OneShot install on Steam. Right-click on OneShot -> Properties -> Local Files tab -> Verify integrity of game cache
2 - Clone the repository on your computer
3 - Go to the repository, and open the file "b_setup.bat" (Right-click, edit...)
4 - Change `steam=C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\OneShot` to the proper steam folder on your computer, save and close
5 - Execute b_setup.bat

Now unless you reclone the repository, you won't need to run the setup again.

- Steps after pulling new changes from github
After you pulled changes, you _must_ run "b_unpack.bat". It will apply the github changes onto you steam copy of OneShot.
Once that is done, you can open the editor or play the game as usual.

- Steps before pushing changes to github
Before you push changes, you _must_ run "b_pack.bat". It will detect all the files that are currently in your Steam folder that are different with the original OneShot files.
It'll copy those in "Modified", and we only push those files online.
Unless you know what you're doing, only files from the "Modified" repository should be available to commit.

- Usage
Open Game.rxproj with RPGXP to modify the game. Once you've done a few changes, make sure to save the project, and start the game in Steam.
No need to do anything else.

If there's any problem, contact me @Jokie on the OneShot Discord.
