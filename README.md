CrackShot
a stellar mod of a fantastic video game

CrackShot is a collaberative project between OneShot fans, set to pretty much ruin the entire game. 


Guidelines for the Project:
Here’s the set-up for CrackShot: Niko licks the acid after pouring it onto the sponge to clean the RowBot. What happens next is a bunch of terrible jokes and hallucinating Niko. Most of the dialogue up till when Niko pours the acid on the sponge shouldn’t be changed directly. 
To modify the project, i highly recommend downloading the Drive App (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive/index.html?hl=en), which will allow you to modify the project files from your computer within RPG Maker XP. This is potentially unstable so we’ll have a lot of backups just to be safe. Looking into it atm
We are sectioning certain maps/variables of dialogue off to those wanting to work on them. 
For Art and Music, use the “Art Assets and Crap” Folder and put it in it’s respective folder
Update: Looking into Github at the moment
